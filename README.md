# 📋 PaperTrail

**PaperTrail** is a full-stack receipt scanner and personal finance tracker built using **Java** and **JavaFX**.  
It helps users manage tasks, organize receipts, and track budgets — all in one place.  
The app includes:

- ✅ **Task Manager**
- 🧾 **Receipt Manager**
- 💰 **Budget Manager**

All components are built with a clean, modular JavaFX UI. The codebase is heavily commented to support learning and documentation — especially since this is my first full GUI build from scratch in JavaFX.

## 🚧 Roadmap & Future Plans

PaperTrail is designed to grow into a more advanced personal finance tool. Planned features include:

- 🔄 Migrating from manual JSON saving to **SQL database integration**
- 🔍 Integrating OCR using a **REST API** for automatic receipt scanning
- ⚠️ Budget limit warnings and smarter notifications
- 📊 Expense analytics by category or month

These additions will push the project toward a more scalable, real-world-ready tool — while helping me grow as a full-stack software engineer.

## 🧠 Developer Notes

This project reflects my ongoing learning journey. Every part of the codebase — from structure to comments — is built for clarity, maintainability, and future expansion. The focus isn’t just building a tool, but **building it the right way**, with clean design, clear purpose, and room to grow.

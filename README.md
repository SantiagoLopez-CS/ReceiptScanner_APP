# 📋 PaperTrail

**PaperTrail** is a JavaFX desktop application designed to help users manage **budgets, receipts, and tasks** in a single, organized workflow.  
The project focuses on clean architecture, usability, and real-world application structure using **Java**, **JavaFX**, and **MVC principles**.

## ✨ Features

- 💰 **Budget Manager**
    - Create and manage budgets with spending limits
    - Track spending progress and remaining balances

    - Designed for future OCR-based receipt scanning

- ✅ **Task Manager**
    - Create, sort, and manage tasks
    - Separate completed and incomplete tasks for clarity

Each module is built as a dedicated JavaFX view with its own controller and validation logic.

## 🧱 Architecture

- **Language:** Java (17+)
- **UI Framework:** JavaFX
- **Architecture Pattern:** MVC (Model–View–Controller)
- **Design Focus:**
    - Modular controllers
    - Clear separation of concerns
    - Maintainable, readable code

The codebase is structured to support future expansion without major refactoring.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts

- Java & JavaFX
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- MVC Architecture
- Input Validation & Error Handling
- Collections & Data Structures
- File-based persistence (in progress)

## 🚧 Roadmap & Planned Enhancements

PaperTrail is actively evolving toward a more production-ready personal finance tool.

Planned features include:
- 💾 Persistent storage using **JSON and/or SQL**
- 🔍 **OCR integration via REST API** for automatic receipt scanning
- ⚠️ Budget limit warnings and visual indicators
- 📊 Expense analytics by category and time period

Each feature is implemented incrementally with versioned milestones.

## 🧠 Developer Notes

PaperTrail was built to mirror how real-world desktop applications are designed — not as a tutorial project, but as a scalable foundation.  
The emphasis is on **clean structure, predictable behavior, and long-term maintainability**, while continuing to expand functionality over time.
